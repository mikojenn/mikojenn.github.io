        <h3 id="pathtofame">Path to Fame</h3>
        Within a month after her first cover of "Don't Wanna Be Torn", Christina took her first step to stardom with her
        new
        cover of Miley Cyrus' "Party in the USA". With present view count of over 12 million, this video allowed her to
        gain
        some publicity as well as recognition of her talents by the YouTube community.

      <div>
        <h3>Popular YT Performances</h3>
        Party in the USA was just the beginning as Christina kept honing her talents and becoming a minor celebrity in
        the
        YouTube community. Most of her releases reached view count of more than a million per video. Christina was just
        getting
        started!

      <div>
        <h3>YouTube Competition</h3>
        On December 6th 2010, Christina released a video announcing her invitation to the YouTube competition. She was
        competing
        with big name stars like Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and Rihanna. Despite her fierce competitors, she still
        placed in
        the top five and ranked second behind Selena Gomez; setting herself above Justin Bieber, Rihanna, and Nicki
        Minaj.

        As Christina's fan base and subscription to her channel kept growing, she gained more recognition for her vocal
        talents.
        She was noticed by Selena Gomez's stepfather, Brian Teefey, who became interested in Christina's talents after
        watching
        several performance. Around the time after Christina's performance of 'Miley Cyrus Medley' produced by Kurt Hugo
        Schneider, Brian Teefey contacted Grimmie and became her manager.

        <h3 id="magical">Start of Something Magical</h3>
        With Brian Teefey as her manager, Christina was well on her way in releasing her own album; "Find Me" EP was
        released
        for digital download on June 14, 2011. Although the physical album was not widely commercially released,
        physical albums
        were sold during her live performances while she toured and opened for Selena Gomez on her "We Own the Night
        Tour". The
        album was released independent of any label and debuted at #35 on Billboard 200 chart; entering top 10 (6) for
        "Independent Albums" in the US. Wanting to ensure that anyone could afford to buy her music, "Find Me" was sold
        at a low
        price of $5.99.

      <time></time>
      <div>
        <h3 id="appearances">Making an Appearance </h3>
        Christina made various appearances on popular shows and events such as "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" (Oct. 10,
        2011), "39th
        American Music Award" (Nov. 20, 2011), Disney Channel's "So Random!" (Dec. 11, 2011), and "Dancing with the
        Stars" (Oct.
        16, 2012).

        Signed! with Creative Artist Agency 'With Love'
        January 2012, Christina moved to Los Angeles and signed with Creative Artist Agency as well as starring on
        Disney.com
        web show "Power Up: with Christina Grimmie" (Mar. 29, 2012 - Jun. 5, 2012) where she was able to talk about one
        of her
        favorite subject: video gaming. Christina joined up with Selena Gomez and opened for her "Star Dance Tour" where
        she was
        able to perform songs from her upcoming second album "With Love" (Aug. 6, 2013).

        <h3 id="thevoice">The Voice 2014</h3>
        During the 2014 "The Voice" competition, Grimmie auditioned for a spot by singing Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball"
        where all
        four coaches, immediately, approved and turned around to receive her. She was hotly contested after by the
        coaches and
        Grimmie eventually decided to go with Adam Levine as her coach. She placed 3rd in the competition behind Josh
        Kaufman
        (winner) and Jake Worthington (runner-up).


        Adam Levine, who coached Christina during her competition in "The Voice", expressed his intentions to sign
        Grimmie on
        with "222 Records" and sign a record deal. Fans of Grimmie wondered why she didn't outright sign on post-"The
        Voice".
        According to "Sawdah" from "The Real Grimmie Blog", having to sign various contracts with NBC to be on the show,
        there
        may have been conflicts that did not allow Grimmie to sign with a competing record label: Universal Music Group
        vs
        Interscope Records (222 Records). In the end, Grimmie signed on with Island Records where she released her new
        single
        "Must Be Love".
